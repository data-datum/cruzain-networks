# Network Analysis for activity cliff comprehension in halogenated cruzain inhibitors - Repository

Folders:
* `scripts`: scripts for the Bio3D for DCC matrix, shortest paths files between critical interacting residues, communities for proteins, and betweenness calculations. 
* `results`: contains the output file of the previous calculations. 

### Workflow analysis of halogenated cruzain inhibitors

1. Selection of group of inhbitors (based on the literature available). In this case, the group of inhibitors are from tiosemicarbazones compounds. 
2. Selection of minimum energy conformations with docking simulations. 
3. Selection of critical interacting residues with betweenness calculations. 
4. Calculation of DCCM Matrix. 
5. Calculation of shortest paths between critical interacting residues. 
6. Principal component analysis
